# MineSafe - Miner Health & Safety Monitoring Dashboard

MineSafe is a real-time miner health and safety monitoring dashboard built using **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Chart.js**.  
The dashboard provides miner vitals, seismic activity, zone-based grouping, and a clean interactive UI for industrial mining operations.

 ⚡ Real-time ECG heart rate monitoring (simulated data)
 🌡️ Dynamic CO₂ and Oxygen level monitoring
 🌍 Zone monitoring panel with miner groupings
 🪨 Seismic activity level tracking
 🎨 Light/Dark theme toggle
 💻 Clean responsive UI with animated elements
 ✅ Contact Miner button with floating modal
 🪄 Smooth hover effects and glassmorphism styling

 🛠️ Tech Stack

 **React + Vite** → Frontend framework
